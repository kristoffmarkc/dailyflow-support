# Privacy Policy for DailyFlow

**Last Updated: January 07, 2025**

## Introduction

DailyFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application DailyFlow (the "App").

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

DailyFlow is designed with privacy in mind. The App:

- Does **not** collect personal data
- Does **not** require account creation
- Does **not** track your location
- Does **not** access your contacts, photos, or other personal files
- Does **not** use analytics or tracking tools
- Does **not** contain advertisements
- Does **not** share any data with third parties

## In-App Purchases

DailyFlow offers a one-time Premium upgrade that unlocks additional features. The purchase is processed securely through Apple's App Store and StoreKit framework. We do not receive or store any payment information — all transactions are handled entirely by Apple.

## Data Storage

All data you create in DailyFlow (tasks, lists, diary entries, flow entries) is stored **locally on your device only**. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted over the internet
- Is not accessible to us or any third party
- Is included in your device's backup (iCloud or iTunes) if you have backups enabled

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security features, including:

- Device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- iOS encryption

## Children's Privacy

DailyFlow does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App is suitable for users of all ages as it does not collect any personal information.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal information for us to access, modify, or delete. All your data is under your control on your device.

To delete your data:
- Delete individual tasks, diary entries, or flow entries within the App
- Delete the App to remove all associated data

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
